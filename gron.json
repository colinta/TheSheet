We went to a dwarven settlement where we were led to a cave, out of the cave came a Silver dragon, which after some fighting turned into Gron. Then Kevin Everyman awoke as Osilith, and took us to his \"birthplace\" where he was created, some sort of weapon against – maybe – Skynet.

We meet Jorn Jonah Marbury, Fenric Marbury (son), and Zoarah Marbury, introduced as his daughter but maybe adopted. Their guide is an Elf named Falcon. We join them to their hunting lodge. Falcon agrees that \"Araugauthos\" sounds draconic, no other information, no dragon sightings. We stay at the lodge that night, Gron has a dream of a silver *or white* dragon that says \"You magic will grow.\"\nThe next day we go through the woods an come across a boulder and Gron jumps onto it, it turns out to be a troll and it quickly knocks Gron unconscious, but someone heals him. The troll regenerates but casting Chill Touch stops the regeneration.\nAt the camp the tents are empty. Gron casts an illusion of a worm to trick Hatharal, and then a wormy arm thing attacks Gron.

It had sediment that wouldn't be found in a farm field - a mine maybe (flecks of metal).\nWe run into a group of 4 harpies and almost get wiped out. They have the mark of Talos - maybe there are more orcs in this area.
